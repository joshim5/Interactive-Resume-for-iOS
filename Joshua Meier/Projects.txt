Mishneh Torah for iOS

The Mishneh Torah, the first comprehensive code of Jewish law, was composed by Maimonides (1135-1204), one of historyâ€™s most preeminent Rabbis. I revitalized the Mishneh Torah for the 21st century, profiting thousands of dollars. Design is key along with search, bookmark, browsing, and sharing features.

Rapid Aging Control

When we get older, our cell growth slows. In my project, I harnessed this aging process to treat diseases. By understanding rapid aging, I 'aged' cancer to stop its growth. Conversely, I slowed the rapid aging of artificially-generated stem cells. I also demonstrate applications to other age-related diseases such as Parkinson's and diabetes.
